# PropText
Simple library for use standard fonts on CMM2 as proportional ones. You need just call either initAll.PROP (initialise all built-in fonts for use as proportional, takes some time) or initFont.PROP(fontnumber) for just one specific font. Then simply call text.PROP with similar parameters as built-in TEXT command (with some limitations).
This library can be used for example in text adventures, because of better readability of texts...
